## Governance

## Goals
The goal of governance for the project is to maintain and emphasize a technical meritocracy of contributors.  Those 
who contribute the most and the best technical solutions, have the most influence in the direction of the project.  
An element of benevolent dictatorship exists per component and at an overall project level to keep the project 
successful and resolve conflict.

## Structure
The project consists of many repositories that will change over time as the project evolves. Each repository is 
expected to be self governing with a maintainer leading it.
  
  
## Roles and responsibilities
- *Contributors* are people who have submitted work to the project.  Work includes all kinds of tasking, including 
things like code, tests, code reviews, documentation, infrastructure and proposals.
- *Maintainers* have permission to accept pull requests and merge them into the master branch of a given repository.  
Each repository contains a MAINTAINERS file listing the maintainers.  There must be one or more named maintainers 
per repository.
- The *Project Leader* is responsible for the success of the project and resolving conflict between the maintainers 
and keep the project. A Project Leader is appointed by the Open Compute Project community.

## Conflict Resolution 
Each repository is expected to resolve conflicts for itself and between dependent repositories.  If a resolution 
cannot be found in a reasonable time, the issue will be escalated to the Project Leader who will help the teams 
find a solution to move the project forward.
